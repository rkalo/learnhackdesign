<h1> Welcome to Learn HackDesign </h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Robert Kalomiris. I created this blog so I could document my experience of going through the HackDesign Program. 
This blog's goals are two-fold: I primarily wanted to have some kind of simple online space where I can keep track of my progress through
all of the lesson plans. Also, writing blog entries is a fantastic learing aid and having a dedicated blog means that I could gamify the 
entire process of absorbing the material.</p>
<p>I created this blog using the combination of Jekyll and Github Pages.</p>
